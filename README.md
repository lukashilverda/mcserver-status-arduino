\## Introduction



\* PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on \[Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)

\* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions)

\* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.

\* This repository contains source code for Android. For iOS/iPadOS, check out \[PojavLauncher\_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher\_iOS).



\## Getting PojavLauncher



You can get PojavLauncher via three methods:



1\. \*\*Releases:\*\* Download the prebuilt app from our \[stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or \[automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).

2\. \*\*Google Play:\*\* Get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge: \[!\[Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en\_us/badges/static/images/badges/en\_badge\_web\_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)

3\. \*\*Build from Source:\*\* Follow the \[building instructions](#building) below.



\## Building



\### Quick Build (Recommended)



The easiest way to build PojavLauncher is to use the pre-built JREs provided by our CI.



1\. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher.git`

2\. Build the launcher: `./gradlew :app\_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows)



The built APK will be located in `app\_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.



\### Detailed Build



If you need more control over the build process, follow these steps:



1\. \*\*Java Runtime Environment (JRE):\*\* Download the `jre8-pojav` artifact from our \[CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).  This package contains pre-built JREs for all supported architectures.  If you need to build the JRE yourself, follow the instructions in the \[android-openjdk-build-multiarch](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch) repository.



2\. \*\*LWJGL:\*\* The build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the \[LWJGL repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3).



3\. \*\*Language List:\*\* Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:

&nbsp;  \* Linux/macOS:

&nbsp;    ```bash

&nbsp;    chmod +x scripts/languagelist\_updater.sh

&nbsp;    bash scripts/languagelist\_updater.sh

&nbsp;    ```

&nbsp;  \* Windows:

&nbsp;    ```batch

&nbsp;    scripts\\languagelist\_updater.bat

&nbsp;    ```



4\. \*\*Build GLFW stub:\*\* `./gradlew :jre\_lwjgl3glfw:build`



5\. \*\*Build the launcher:\*\* `./gradlew :app\_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` on Windows).
